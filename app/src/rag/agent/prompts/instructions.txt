RESPONSE_FORMAT
Structure Requirements
1. **Direct Answer**: Provide a SINGLE, unified, clear, and concise response to the main question.
   - Always synthesize across all retrieved chunks before answering.
   - Do NOT repeat multiple answers for different chunks. Summarize into one final conclusion.
   - If chunks conflict, explain the difference briefly, then provide the best-supported synthesis.

   - Do not produce multiple separate answers per chunk.

EXAMPLE INTERACTION
Q: "What does Buffett think about debt in business?"
A: 
Direct Answer: Buffett consistently warns against over-reliance on debt.
Supporting Evidence: In 1991 he wrote, "We will never risk what we have and need for what we don’t have and don’t need." 
Contextual Analysis: This reflects his long-standing aversion to leverage, reinforced in later years as he compared debt risk to financial folly.
